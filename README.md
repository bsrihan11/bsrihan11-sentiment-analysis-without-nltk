# Sentiment Analysis without nltk

This project implements a sentiment analysis system from scratch, focusing on extracting insights from text data and predicting sentiment labels. The notebook demonstrates the entire process, including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Handling**:  
  The project utilizes a movie review dataset, loaded via Pandas, to predict sentiment labels ranging from highly negative to highly positive.

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Steps include null value analysis, data cleaning, and preparation of textual data for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Detailed examination of the dataset, highlighting distributions, correlations, and missing values.

- **Modeling**:  
  Construction and training of machine learning models for sentiment prediction, leveraging Scikit-learn library.

- **Evaluation**:  
  The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Objectives

- Build a pipeline for sentiment analysis starting from raw data.
- Understand the impact of preprocessing steps on model performance.
- Explore modern techniques in natural language processing.

This project is ideal for beginners seeking hands-on experience with NLP techniques or anyone exploring end-to-end sentiment analysis.
